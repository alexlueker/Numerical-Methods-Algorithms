# Linear Regression Algorithm
Allows user to find the linear regression line of a data set aswell as the R^2 value, signaling correlation between trend line and data set
## INPUTS
* x- values of the data set
* y- values of the data set

## OUTPUTS
* fX- Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* fY- Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* slope- Slope from the linear regression (m in )
* intercept- Intercept from the linear regression (b in )
* Rsquared- Rsquared value
